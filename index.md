## About Me
My name is Asma Baig, and I am a Cybersecurity graduate student at DePaul University graduating in Summer 2024 with a keen interest in Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science, specializing in Quantitative Analysis and Operations Research, from DePaul University. As a first-generation student, I am excited to gain research experience and delve into computer science beyond the classroom. I am particularly interested in applying good security practices to various aspects of technology, from email security to cyber-physical systems in addition to focusing on mobility models and ad hoc networks, which I find fascinating for their potential in enhancing network efficiency and security.My dream is to pursue a Ph.D. as I'm very interested in prysing a career in high education and academia. 

In my free time, I enjoy running, painting, and playing board games. I also love visiting amusement parks like Six Flags and Cedar Point, which are a fun staple for my summer breaks. When I'm feeling creative, I like experimenting with new brownie recipes and challenging my friends to guess the ingredients.
