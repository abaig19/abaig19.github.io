## About Me
My name is Asma Baig, and I am a Cybersecurity graduate student at DePaul University graduating in Summer 2024 with a keen interest in Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science, specializing in Quantitative Analysis and Operations Research, from DePaul University. As a first-generation student, I am excited to gain research experience and delve into computer science beyond the classroom. I am particularly interested in applying good security practices to various aspects of technology, from email security to cyber-physical systems in addition to focusing on mobility models and ad hoc networks, which I find fascinating for their potential in enhancing network efficiency and security. My ultimate goal is to pursue a Ph.D. and build a career in academia, where I can contribute to the field and inspire future researchers.

In my free time, I enjoy running, painting, and playing board games. I also love visiting amusement parks like Six Flags and Cedar Point, which are a fun staple for my summer breaks. When I'm feeling creative, I like experimenting with new brownie recipes and challenging my friends to guess the ingredients.

## About My Project

The project focuses on using Cellular Automata models to predict bike movements in urban environments to improve wireless access point (WAP) placement. By modeling bike trajectories, the goal is to strategically deploy WAPs to ensure reliable wireless connectivity and eliminate connectivity dead spots for bike riders in urban grids.
