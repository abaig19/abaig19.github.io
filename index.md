## About Me
My name is Asma Baig, and I am a Cybersecurity graduate student at DePaul University graduating in Summer 2024 with a keen interest in Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science, specializing in Quantitative Analysis and Operations Research, from DePaul University. As a first-generation student, I am excited to gain research experience and delve into computer science beyond the classroom. I am particularly interested in applying good security practices to various aspects of technology, from email security to cyber-physical systems in addition to focusing on mobility models and ad hoc networks, which I find fascinating for their potential in enhancing network efficiency and security.My dream is to pursue a Ph.D. as I'm very interested in prysing a career in high education and academia. 

In my free time, I enjoy running, painting, and playing board games. I also love visiting amusement parks like Six Flags and Cedar Point, which are a fun staple for my summer breaks. When I'm feeling creative, I like experimenting with new brownie recipes and challenging my friends to guess the ingredients.

## About My Advisor

My advisor for this research project is Sharief Oteafy. Dr. Oteafy is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at Jarvis College of Computing and Digital Media, DePaul University, and a senior IEEE member. He also hold the position of Adjunct Associate Professor in the School of Computing at Queen's University. He founded the Next Generation Networking (NexGeN) lab at DePaul University, where he focuses on interdisciplinary development in IoT and Tactile Internet architectures. He collaborates with the Telecommunications Research Lab at Queenâ€™s University and am the lead technical editor and secretary for the IEEE P1918.1 Tactile Internet Standard, set for publication in Q1 2023. Dr. Oteafy research interests span novel paradigms in sensor networks, advancing core technologies in the Internet of Things and synergy efforts in next generation context-aware sensing systems and content-centric networks.

## About My Project

The project focuses on using Cellular Automata models to predict bike movements in urban environments to improve wireless access point (WAP) placement. By modeling bike trajectories, the goal is to strategically deploy WAPs to ensure reliable wireless connectivity and eliminate connectivity dead spots for bike riders in urban grids.
