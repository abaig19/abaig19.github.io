## Entry 1 

This week, we explore how Cellular Automata (CA) models can be employed to predict bike trajectories in urban settings. By modeling bike movements, we aim to optimize the placement of wireless access points (WAPs) to ensure reliable connectivity. The challenge lies in accurately representing bike trajectories to strategically position WAPs, thereby enhancing coverage and connectivity for urban cyclists.

Research Problem: Ensuring reliable wireless connectivity for bike riders in urban environments is challenging due to the dynamic nature of bike movements and the presence of connectivity dead spots. Cellular automata models can be employed to predict bike trajectories, which can then be used to optimize the deployment of scarce wireless access points (WAPs). The challenge lies in effectively modeling these trajectories so WAPs can be strategically placed, ensuring comprehensive coverage and connectivity for all bike riders.

This week, we evaluate various mobility models to improve bike trajectory simulations in urban settings. We will consider how different models—such as Random Waypoint, Random Direction, Gauss-Markov, and Distributed Pheromone Repel—can be adapted to better represent bike movements and optimize wireless access point placement.

Models to Explore:

- Random Waypoint (RWP) Mobility Model: Nodes (bikes) follow predefined routes, mimicking bike lanes and popular cycling routes, and avoid congested areas.
- Random Direction (RD) Mobility Model: Nodes vary their speeds to simulate different biking conditions and pause at intersections or traffic lights.
- Gauss-Markov (GM) Mobility Model: Incorporates terrain data to influence speed variations, with bikes slowing down on uphill slopes and speeding up on downhill sections.
- Distributed Pheromone Repel (DPR) Mobility Model: Bikes favor routes with higher access point density or stronger signals to maintain reliable connectivity.

## Entry 3
This week, we focus on refining the Gauss-Markov (GM) Mobility Model by incorporating dynamic speed adjustments based on terrain. This modification aims to enhance the accuracy of bike trajectory simulations by adapting speed to various terrain types encountered during urban biking.

Modification: Dynamic Speed Adjustment Based on Terrain

- Terrain Classification: Categorize terrain types (e.g., flat roads, uphill slopes).
- Speed Adjustment Algorithm: Develop algorithms to adjust bike speed for different terrains, ensuring realistic simulations of biking behaviors.
- Integration with GM Model: Incorporate these adjustments into the Gauss-Markov model to improve simulation accuracy.

## Entry 4 
This week’s focus is on integrating the proposed mobility models into a comprehensive framework for optimizing wireless access point (WAP) deployment. We will discuss various path-aware mobility models, the incorporation of terrain data, and practical applications in different settings.

Outline:

- Mobility Models in VANETs: Background and comparison of Gauss-Markov, Pheromone, and Paparazzi models.
- Terrain Data Integration: Modifying the GM model to include terrain effects.
- Case Studies: Application of the model in different fictuous urban settings
- Optimization of WAP Deployment: Strategic placement based on predicted bike densities and movement patterns.
- Performance Evaluation: Metrics for effectiveness, including coverage percentage and connectivity reliability.

## Entry 5 
Introduction: This week, we compare the effectiveness of various mobility models for simulating bike trajectories in urban environments, focusing on how well each model adapts to terrain effects and movement patterns.

Comparison:

- Gauss-Markov (GM) Model: Best suited for urban bike trajectories, particularly with terrain adjustments.
- Paparazzi (PPRZM) Model: Effective for specific movement patterns but less adaptable to varied urban terrains.
- Distributed Pheromone Repel (DPR) Model: More suitable for exploration scenarios but less effective for realistic urban bike movement modeling.
- Summary: The GM model is recommended for its realistic simulation of bike trajectories in urban settings, while the PPRZM and DPR models offer benefits for specific scenarios but may not fully capture urban biking dynamics.
